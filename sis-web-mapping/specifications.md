Specifications:

- Dockerized application
- Based on Openlayers js library
- Build it in folder: FAO/GloSIS/gsis-web-mapping
- Docker compose already has an entry for this application: gsis-web-mapping. Use this docker-compose.yml and change it there if needed (this service only, the other are working fine).
- The mockup of the web-mapping was hand made on paper an the picture of it is FAO/GloSIS/gsis-web-mapping/website_mockup.jpg.
- As you can see in the image, the layer swhicher is on the left and is collapsible, by default it is not, only when the user wants.
- Layer swhicher containes all grup layers including Base Maps, and below the Opacity controler. Opacity controler is inside the Layer swhicher pane.
- Layer swhicher pane does not take all the vertical length od the screen, as shown in the image.
- On the top right we have the North arrow and the zoom controls.
- On the bottom right we have the scale in meters.
- All the layers that will be present in the web-mapping already have a web-service (glosis-ws), metadata (glosis-md).
- All layers are listed in file FAO/GloSIS/gsis-web-mapping/layer_info.csv:
    - 1 collumn is the name layer group
    - 2 column is the name of the file layer
    - 3 column is the code of the soil property
    - 4 column is the name of the soil property
    - 5 column is the unit of measure
    - 6 column is the soil depth
    - 7 column link to the metadata of that layer
    - 8 column link to download the GeoTIFF of that layer
    - 9 column link to the WMD GetMap request of that layer
    - 10 column link to the WMD GetLegendGraphic request of that layer
    - 11 column link to the WMD GetFeatureInfo request of that layer
- There are 4 layer groups (project_name), put them by this order and make them collapsible:
    - Soil Profiles
    - Soil Nutrients
    - Salt-Affected Soils
    - Organic Carbon Sequestration Potential
    - Base Maps, the following maps and order:
        - ESRI imagery map
        - OpenStreetmap
        - Open terrain map
- Under each group should appear the list of layers (layer_id) available for tha group layer (project_name).
- The layers should use the name of layer_id.
- On mouse over the layer, show the property_name.
- Next to each layer show two icons, one for metadata (metadata_url) and another for download (download_url).
- It's only possible to select one Base Map.
- It's only possible to select one layer from all layer grooups, except for profile layer! Because it is a point layer and can be overlaped with other layers.
- Mobile friendly
